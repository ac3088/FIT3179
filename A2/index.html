                Per IFRC, "Disasters are serious disruptions to the functioning of a community that exceed its capacity
                to
                cope
                using its own resources."
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-style: italic;">Natural disasters</span> are those that are caused by severe weather
                or
                climate events, or are in some way related to a natural phenomenon, rather than a man-made one.

            When it comes to the human toll of a disaster, <span class="asia">Asia</span> and <span
                class="africa">Africa</span> have had it the
            worst, both in terms of the number of overall people affected, and the death tolls they have endured.

            The bar chart shown above displays the 10 countries who had the largest death toll due to natural disasters
            since 1960. All of the countries in the top 10 are either <span class="asia">Asian</span> or <span
                class="africa">African</span>, with the top 3 all being in the South Asia/East Asia region.
            <br><br>
            The scatterplot shows every recorded natural disaster (in the dataset) since 1960, plotted against the
            number of people the disaster affected, with each colour representing a different region. Moving the slider
            to the right will show disasters which affected <span style="font-weight:bold;">at least</span> that many
            of people.
            <br><br>
            The chart shows that <span class="asia">Asia</span> has the majority of high-impact disasters, including
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">all</span> disasters that affected over 100 million people.

        <div id="region_piechart"></div>
        <p class="text">
            Notably, <span class="asia">Asia</span> has also endured the most natural disasters out of any region,
            reporting thousands more disasters than the <span class="americas">Americas</span>, more than double the
            number of disasters in <span class="africa">Africa</span>, and over triple the number of reported disasters
            in <span class="europe">Europe</span>.

            When it comes to damages/costs, <span style="font-weight:bold;">The United States</span> has gotten the
            short end of the stick, with it having lost more than both <span style="font-weight: bold;">China</span> and
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Japan</span> combined, which are the second and third most affected nations
            in this case, respectively.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, the cost of natural disasters seems to be increasing over time, with the total damages each
            year caused by disasters generally trending upwards.

        <p class="text">
            <span class="storms">Storms</span> and <span class="floods">floods</span> are the most common natural
            disasters, accounting for over <span style="font-weight: bold;">50%</span> of reported natural disasters
            since 1960.
            <br><br>
            <span style="font-style: italic;">
                Note that these statistics are not reflected in the above map, as locational data for many natural

            Historically, the deadliest type of natural disaster has been <span class="droughts">droughts</span>.
            However, more recently, <span class="extreme_temp">extreme temperatures</span> and <span
                class="earthquakes">earthquakes</span> tend to cause more deaths on average in a given year compared to
            <span class="droughts">droughts</span>, albeit the average deaths has dropped significantly.
            <br><br>
            The bar chart above shows the average number of deaths caused by each type of natural disaster from
            the given year to 2023. As the year range approaches the present year, <span
                class="earthquakes">earthquakes</span> and <span class="extreme_temp">extreme temperatures</span> become
            the most deadly disasters on average, overtaking
