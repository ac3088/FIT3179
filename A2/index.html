    <h1 id="title">The Impact of Natural Disasters</h1>
    <p class="text_1">
        Per IFRC, "Disasters are serious disruptions to the functioning of a community that exceed its capacity to cope
        using its own resources."
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Natural disasters</span> are those that are caused by severe weather or
        climate events, or are in some way related to a natural phenomenon, rather than a man-made one.
    </p>
    <div id="symbol_map"></div>
    <div>
        <p class="text_2">
            <span class="storms">Storms</span> and <span class="floods">floods</span> are the most common natural
            disasters, accounting for over <span style="font-weight: bold;">50%</span> of reported natural disasters
            since 1960.
            <br><br>
            <span style="font-style: italic;">
                Note that these statistics are not reflected in the above map, as locational data for many natural
                disasters(notably storms) was not available.

        In total, these disasters have caused nearly 4 trillion USD in damages, and taken over 5 million lives.
